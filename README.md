# HospitalNetwork
*Building networks of hospitals through patients transfers*

This R package contains functions to help interested researchers to build hospital networks from data on hospitalized patients transferred between hospitals. 

The aim of the project is to provide a common framework to build and analyse hospital networks.

This project is partly supported by the NeWIS (NetWorks to Improve Surveillance) initiative, funded by JPIAMR, and by Sphinx project, funded by ANR.
